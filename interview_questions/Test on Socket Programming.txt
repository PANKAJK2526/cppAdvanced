Here is a comprehensive list of **medium-level socket programming interview questions in C++ using the Qt library** (primarily using `QTcpSocket`, `QTcpServer`, `QUdpSocket`, `QNetworkAccessManager`, and related classes):

---

### **QTcpSocket / QTcpServer (TCP)**

1. What is the role of `QTcpServer` and how does it work with `QTcpSocket`?
2. How do you handle multiple client connections in Qt TCP server?
3. Explain the signal-slot mechanism used for new connections in `QTcpServer`.
4. How can you detect client disconnection in `QTcpSocket`?
5. How do you send and receive structured data (e.g., JSON or binary) over `QTcpSocket`?
6. How would you implement a heartbeat or ping mechanism in a Qt TCP server?
7. What is `waitForConnected()` and when should it be used?
8. How does Qt handle asynchronous reading and writing over `QTcpSocket`?
9. What are the potential issues with blocking sockets and how does Qt avoid them?
10. How can you implement SSL/TLS support in a Qt TCP socket application?
11. How do you deal with partial reads/writes in `QTcpSocket`?
12. What are the common signals emitted by `QTcpSocket` and their usage?

### **QUdpSocket (UDP)**

13. How is `QUdpSocket` different from `QTcpSocket`?
14. How do you bind a UDP socket to a specific port?
15. Explain how multicast or broadcast communication can be done using `QUdpSocket`.
16. What are the challenges of using UDP in real-time applications and how can you mitigate them in Qt?
17. How do you ensure message integrity or ordering in Qt over UDP?
18. What does `setSocketOption()` do in `QUdpSocket`?

### **General Socket Programming Concepts in Qt**

19. How can you handle large data transfers over Qt sockets?
20. How do you ensure thread safety when accessing a `QTcpSocket` or `QUdpSocket`?
21. How do you design a socket-based client-server architecture in Qt?
22. What are the ways to implement custom protocols over Qt sockets?
23. How do you reuse `QTcpSocket` connections?
24. How do you gracefully shut down a socket server or client?
25. How would you manage timeouts and retries in Qt socket programming?
26. How do you debug or log socket-level communication in Qt?

---

### **QNetworkAccessManager (Optional Higher Layer)**

27. What is the difference between using `QNetworkAccessManager` and raw sockets?
28. How would you send HTTP requests using Qt’s networking classes?
29. How do you handle asynchronous responses with `QNetworkReply`?

### **Error Handling and Performance**

30. What are common socket errors in Qt and how do you handle them?
31. How do you implement non-blocking I/O in Qt sockets?
32. What techniques can you use to improve performance in high-load Qt socket applications?
33. What is the impact of the Qt event loop on socket responsiveness?
34. How do you monitor and manage socket lifetimes and memory usage?
